Hi there,
my name is Amoz
FROM ADVERTISING TO DATA SCIENCE: THE JOURNEY

With half a decade of experience in the communications sphere and a strong focus on all-things data, I have enhanced organisational outcomes through precise, data-driven decision-making. Recognising the importance of data across all industries, I took a break from work to pursue a 12-week intensive Data Science Immersive course from General Assembly. This rigorous program equipped me with advanced skills to navigate and excel in the data science domain.

I have experience in the areas of FMCG, banking, and government agencies, managing high-stakes situations, clarifying complex issues, and driving brand growth. I thrive in diverse team settings, combining analytical acumen with interpersonal skills.

Data isn't merely quantitative; I integrate analysis with human and process dynamics for innovative solutions. I seek opportunities to leverage my skills in data-centric projects, improving your business outcomes through operational efficiencies. Feel free to review my projects below, and provide feedback on where I can improve or collaborate with your business.
